#Demo

#Note
Using Larevel and Lorem Ipsum Generator and Random User Generator package to demonstrate MVC in php for this project. BootStrap template was used and to demonstrate MVC, I've used route and implement BootStrap template to each view that route will call. Within the main _master, I am using @extends to split this template with @yield. Using key features from BootStrap and our Generator packages were challenging but, it is working smooth for users to test it out.
