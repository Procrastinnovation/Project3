Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, and caching.

Laravel aims to make the development process a pleasing one for the developer without sacrificing application functionality. Happy developers make the best code. To this end, we've attempted to combine the very best of what we have seen in other web frameworks, including frameworks implemented in other languages, such as Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET MVC, and Sinatra.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the entire framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).

#Project 3:  Lorem Ipsum Generator and a Random User Generator. 
#By John Lim

#Goal

#Demo
Jing for Project 3 link: http://www.screencast.com/t/mlrwTqPPyC9A

#Note
Using Larevel and Lorem Ipsum Generator and Random User Generator package to demonstrate MVC in php for this project. BootStrap template was used and to demonstrate MVC, I've used route and implement BootStrap template to each view that route will call. Within the main _master, I am using @extends to split this template with @yield. Using key features from BootStrap and our Generator packages were challenging but, it is working smooth for users to test it out.
